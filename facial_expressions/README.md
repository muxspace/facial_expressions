# facial_expressions
A set of images for classifying facial expressions

This repository is a dataset of different facial expressions used for 
training machine learning algorithms.

It is created by my machine learning graduate students.

# Submissions
Please do not use large image files. In general, images should be under 50KB.
Consider that 1000 images at 50KB each is approximately 50MB

# Structure
There are two directories. The `images` directory contains raw images. These
are unprocessed. The `data` directory contains files specific to training.
Most importantly, this includes the `legend.csv`, which maps an image in the
`images` directory with a facial expression. 

This file also has a user ID field. Please use something unique.
It is primarily for tracking which students added which files.
The IDs can be used for a secondary analysis to determine
whether there are any patterns to the submissions.

# Emotions
The set of emoions used are TBD
